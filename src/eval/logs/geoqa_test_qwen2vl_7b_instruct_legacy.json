We can find AD using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD: AD^2 = AB^2 - BD^2 = 1.5^2 - 3.1^2 = 2.25 - 9.61 = -7.36. Since AD cannot be negative, we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's try a different approach. Since AD bisects angle BAC, we have angle BAD = angle CAD. Also, since DE is perpendicular to AB, we have angle ADE = 90 degrees. Therefore, angle ADE = angle CAD. This means that triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC. Using the similarity of triangles, we can set up the following proportion: DE/BC = AD/AC. We know that DE = 1.5 and BD = 3.1.

The fishing boat moves from point A to point B in half an hour, covering a distance of 28.0 nautical miles. This means the fishing boat moves 14.0 nautical miles in the east direction. The angle between the north direction and the line AB is 60 degrees. We can use the cosine rule to find the distance between the lighthouse M and the fishing boat. The cosine rule states that in a triangle ABC, where AB = c, BC = a, AC = b, and angle BAC = α, the length of side AC can be found using the formula: AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 * AB * BC * cos(α). In this case, AB = 14.0, BC = 15.0, and angle BAC = 60 degrees. Substituting these values into the formula, we can find the distance between the lighthouse M and the fishing boat.\n</think>\n<answer>\n16.2 nautical miles",
