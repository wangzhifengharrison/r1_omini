## 📖 Introduction
**R1-Omni** is the industry’s first application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to an Omni-multimodal large language model. We focus on emotion recognition, a task where both visual and audio modalities play crucial roles, to validate the potential of combining RLVR with Omni model. Our findings reveal several key insights:
1) **Enhanced Reasoning Capability**: R1-Omni demonstrate superior reasoning abilities, enabling a clearer understanding of how visual and audio information contribute to emotion recognition.
2) **Improved Understanding Capability**: Compared to SFT, RLVR significantly boosts performance on emotion recognition tasks.
3) **Stronger Generalization Capability**: RLVR models exhibit markedly better generalization capabilities, particularly excelling in out-of-distribution scenarios.



## 📦 Model Download
We chose the open-source Omni model HumanOmni-0.5B as our base model. We have open-sourced the following: the base model HumanOmni-0.5B, the cold-start model EMER-SFT, the model MAFW-DFEW-SFT fine-tuned directly on the MAFW and DFEW training sets, and our final model R1-Omni.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup
Our code is built on the R1-V framework. To set up the environment, please follow the installation instructions in the [R1-V repository](https://github.com/Deep-Agent/R1-V/)
Nvidia-driver，535.54，torch 2.5.1+cu124，torchvision 0.20.1+cu124 torchaudio 2.5.1+cu124transformers 4.49.0， flash_attn 2.7.4 


## 🔍 Inference
Our inference code is based on the implementation from **HumanOmni**. To ensure the model runs inference smoothly, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Required Models**：
   - [siglip-224](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-base-patch16-224).
   - [whisper-large-v3](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3).
   - [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased)

2. **Update the Configuration File**：
   - In the directory where you downloaded the R1-Omni model, locate the config.json file.
   - Update the paths on line 23 and line 31 to point to the local folders where you saved the models.
   - Update the path on line 21 in inferece.py to point to the local folder where you saved the bert-base-uncased.


#### Example: Updating config.json and inference.py
If you saved the models to the following local paths:：
- `/path/to/local/models/siglip-base-patch16-224`
- `/path/to/local/models/whisper-large-v3`
- `/path/to/local/models/bert_base_uncased`

Update the relevant lines in config.json as follows：
```json
 "mm_audio_tower": "/path/to/local/models/whisper-large-v3",
 "mm_vision_tower": "/path/to/local/models/siglip-base-patch16-224"
```
Update the relevant line in inference.py as follows：
```
  bert_model = "/path/to/local/models/bert_base_uncased"
```

We provide inference.py for singe video inference. 
```
python inference.py --modal video_audio \
  --model_path ./R1-Omni-0.5B \
  --video_path video.mp4 \
  --instruct "As an emotional recognition expert; throughout the video, which emotion conveyed by the characters is the most obvious to you?  Output the thinking process in <think> </think> and final emotion in <answer> </answer> tags."
```



## 🧠 Training
### Cold Start
we initialize the HumanOmni-0.5B by fine-tuning it on a combined dataset consisting of 232 samples from the [Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning](https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/AffectGPT) dataset and 348 samples from HumanOmni dataset.
An example json file of the training data:
```
[
    {
        "video": "MER24/sample_00000967.mp4",
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<video>\n<audio>\nAs an emotional recognition expert; throughout the video, which emotion conveyed by the characters is the most obvious to you? Output the thinking process in <think> </think> and final emotion in <answer> </answer> tags."
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "<think>The video depicts a bright and tranquil indoor setting, where a man in a white Polo shirt stands by the window, engaged in a phone call. His furrowed brow and open mouth suggest he is experiencing tension and anxiety. According to the audio content of the video, his speech is fast-paced, and his tone is filled with confusion and stress. A comprehensive analysis reveals that the man is facing a moderate level of anxiety, closely linked to the challenging phone conversation he is having. Consequently, the entire emotional analysis report emphasizes his anxiety and nervousness in handling challenging situations.</think>\n<answer>anxious</answer>"
            }
        ]
    },
  ...
]
```
All of the cold-start data will be released as soon as possible.

### RLVR
In this stage, we utilize the training sets from the [MAFW](https://mafw-database.github.io/MAFW/) and DFEW(https://dfew-dataset.github.io/) datasets, comprising a total of 15,306 video sample. 
An example json file of the training data:
```
[
    {
        "video": "DFEW/videos/1.mp4",
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<video>\n<audio>\nAs an emotional recognition expert; throughout the video, which emotion conveyed by the characters is the most obvious to you?"
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "sad"
            }
        ],
    },
  ...
]
```
